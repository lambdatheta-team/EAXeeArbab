1	Digital by Default		MIMEAPRINCIPLE001	Business	High	Services should be accessible and delivered digitally as the preferred option.	By digitizing, ministry can provide services that meet the evolving expectations of customers and employees even in a period of tight budgets and complex challenges. Not only do users prefer digital services and interactions with ministry, but digital services can also empower them and broaden their engagement with ministry. In addition, for ministry, digitization reduces wastage of valuable resources and simplifies the administration, presenting an agile face of the ministry to the end user.	Digitizing requires ministry’s attention to three major considerations.i) The first is the core capabilities that ministry uses to engage users and carry out its work: the methods and tools it uses to provide services, the processes it implements, its approach to making decisions, and its sharing and publishing of useful data.ii) The second consideration is the organizational enablers that support ministry in delivering these capabilities: strategy; governance and organization; and leadership, talent, and culture.iii) The third requires ministry establish electronic channels and digitized processes for digital delivery of services (including machine-readable information) as the preferred option (while still keeping other channels open for those who are disconnected by choice or necessity.									1900-01-01	1900-01-01			1	admin	2022-05-24	23:14:21	 	 	 	Create	1	\N	2022-05-24 23:14:22
2	Value for Money		MIMEAPRINCIPLE002	Business	High	Ministry business initiatives and investments must represent value for money and return a business benefit.	A service that does not have an understood return on investment (ROI) is unlikely to receive the on-going support and commitment that will make it sustainable. It is essential for the ministry to meet the following rules: value for money, encouraging competition, efficient, effective and ethical use of resources, andaccountability and transparency.	1) Business initiatives will need to be fit for purpose and deliver value and benefit.2) Ministry will need to assess the ROI for each business initiative.3) A thorough understanding of the costs and benefits is required to establish an appropriate investment model to support the creation and on-going management of the service.4) A total cost of ownership (TCO) approach will be required to assess the investment against other priorities.5) The value and cost of investments need to be measurable in objective terms.									1900-01-01	1900-01-01			1	admin	2022-05-24	23:14:21	 	 	 	Create	1	\N	2022-05-24 23:14:22
3	Enterprise Architecture Approval		MIMEAPRINCIPLE003	Business	High	All projects, programs and strategic changes are subject to enterprise architecture approval at key stages throughout the delivery lifecycle.	Rationale This ensures that projects/changes collectively move in the business and technology direction that are required by the ministry’s EA. This also controls and prevents divergence from strategic intent and helps understand the trade-offs around any divergence.	1) Develop and operate strategically aligned enterprise architecture (EA) that encompasses multiple domains – business; data; application; technology and information security. The stakeholders’ requirements from both business and technology should provide the basis for the foundation of enterprise architecture.2) Changes should be aligned with the future architecture state of the ministry.3) Changes to the architecture need to be formally managed so that divergence is controlled.4) Exceptions may be granted on the understanding that re-alignment can be achieved at some future date through an approved plan of action. Dispensations would normally be granted for a limited duration only.									1900-01-01	1900-01-01			1	admin	2022-05-24	23:14:21	 	 	 	Create	1	\N	2022-05-24 23:14:22
4	Business Agility		MIMEAPRINCIPLE004	Business	High	Capabilities including business processes, information, applications, and technology assets are able to quickly evolve and adapt to a changing environment.	ministry services need to evolve and adapt without requiring being re-created. With the emergence of cloud services, the ministry needs to promote the use of agile development, services need to be designed to adapt for change, leading to a more rapid and cost-effective reaction, including business assessment and deployment, to changing requirements. 	1) Ministry must adopt approaches that are more agile.2) Ministry should be able to adapt to changing environments, such as increased user demand, business improvement, and technical innovation.3) Ministry should be able to respond successfully and rapidly to changes. 4) Ministry should spend more time and effort on analysis of long-term needs and trends.5) Ministry needs to focus on business-centric, loosely coupled, service-oriented design, e.g. the use of design patterns, rules engines and so on. 									1900-01-01	1900-01-01			1	admin	2022-05-24	23:14:21	 	 	 	Create	1	\N	2022-05-24 23:14:22
5	Business Continuity		MIMEAPRINCIPLE005	Business	High	All business services and activities across the ministry should be operational in spite of systems failures and interruptions.	This protects the ministry in the event that all or part of its operations and/or computer services are rendered unusable. Planning and preparation for business continuity ensure that the ministry overcomes serious incidents or disasters and resumes its normal operations within a reasonably short period.	1) Risks of business interruption must be established in advance and managed. Management includes, but is not limited to, periodic reviews, testing for vulnerability and exposure, or designing mission-critical services to ensure business function continuity through redundant or alternative capabilities.2) Risk management and mitigation plan will need to be developed.3) Recoverability, redundancy, and maintainability should be addressed at the time of design.4) Applications must be assessed for criticality, impact on the ministry’s mission, to determine what level of continuity is required, and what corresponding recovery plan is necessary.									1900-01-01	1900-01-01			1	admin	2022-05-24	23:14:21	 	 	 	Create	1	\N	2022-05-24 23:14:22
6	Ensure Compliance with Relevant Laws, Policies and Standards		MIMEAPRINCIPLE006	Business	High	All IT systems and related processes must comply with the applicable laws, policies and standards. They must also comply with the internal policies and principles, including the EA principles and policies.	Alignment to government regulations is mandatory for compliance, while alignment to internal policies is critical to drive homogeneity in the IT landscape and ministry priorities. Moreover, lack of compliance can lead to unforeseen liabilities and litigation that could otherwise be avoided.	1) Ministry is accountable for the way it manages information and IT services and assets.2) Ministry should ensure that employees are educated and aware of compliance requirements in relation to the use of IT services and assets.3) Compliance requirements across the ministry are consistent, comprehensive, actively monitored and reported and regularly reviewed.4) Ministry shall ensure that all regulatory and compliance requirements are clearly documented, accessible and known across the ministry.5) The highest competent authority shall approve any exceptions.									1900-01-01	1900-01-01			1	admin	2022-05-24	23:14:21	 	 	 	Create	1	\N	2022-05-24 23:14:22
7	Uniform Data Governance and Assigned Data Ownership		MIMEAPRINCIPLE007	Data	High	A uniform data governance model across ministry shall be adopted with clearly identified data governance roles and processes. Each data asset at the ministry has business owner accountable for that information classification and quality.	Without data governance, an organization is unaware of its data landscape, how well it is protected and how much value it bears.Moreover, Data owners are in the best position to define the criticality and sensitivity of the information which sets the basis for classification and can update such information if the status of the information changes.	1) Data governance will be implemented through a set of policies, roles, and processes.2) Data governance and management will need extensive training and change management for the stakeholders and roles will ideally be filled up with a long term perspective3) Owners of each data asset at the ministry level must be assigned.4) Without data ownership and classification, it will be difficult for the information security team to define the level and nature of protection needed for each asset.  The situation could lead to one of the following outcomes:4.1) Lack of protection4.2) Under protection4.3) Over-protection5) Ministry must define and publicize policies, processes, and guidelines for information classification and ownership to assist information owners to understand their responsibility and perform their duties correctly.									1900-01-01	1900-01-01			1	admin	2022-05-24	23:14:21	 	 	 	Create	1	\N	2022-05-24 23:14:22
8	Single Source of Truth and Seamless Data Sharing		MIMEAPRINCIPLE008	Data	High	Data is shared across all departments and functions within the ministry so that data once captured can be utilized to the maximum, while restricting any unauthorized access to data.	There will be a single source of truth and a homogeneous meaning for each data entity, throughout the ministry, to drive confidence in data and ease the effort to maintain dataTimely capture of data and then reusing it enhances user experience (as users no longer submit the same data multiple times), enhances data integrity (as shared data is used across applications) and significantly reduces cost. It is less expensive to maintain data in a single application and share than to maintain duplicate information in multiple applications. The more seamlessly data is shared within the organization, the better it promotes a data-driven culture.	1) All data elements shall have the same meaning across the ministry. This will need the creation and maintenance of a ministry-wide Data Dictionary.2) Ministry shall maintain data elements in the shared information system (or one application to start with) and sharing the data with all applications, instead of having multiple applications maintain the same data element.3) Application design shall maximize the reuse of data (especially shared data) thus minimizing data input requirements from the end-users.4) A comprehensive data sharing policy shall be developed that shall define the principles, standards, and mechanisms for sharing of data within the ministry (between different applications) and externally (open data, sharing with other government bodies and sharing with global entities).									1900-01-01	1900-01-01			1	admin	2022-05-24	23:14:21	 	 	 	Create	1	\N	2022-05-24 23:14:22
9	Data is Trustworthy		MIMEAPRINCIPLE009	Data	High	Data and data services are reliable, accurate, relevant, timely and of high integrity.	Reliable information/data, services and systems that provide consistent outcomes help to reduce complaints, reviews, and appeals from users, consequently improve value.	1) Ministry needs to deliver information, which users can rely upon.2) Good processes create good data.  Processes need to be the focus of ongoing continuous improvement (which in turn will improve reliability, accuracy, relevancy, and timeliness).3) Ministry needs to devote significantly greater effort towards data quality, business continuity, and business process design to ensure reliable information and information systems.									1900-01-01	1900-01-01			1	admin	2022-05-24	23:14:21	 	 	 	Create	1	\N	2022-05-24 23:14:22
10	Common Use Applications		MIMEAPRINCIPLE010	Application	High	The same application is preferred across ministry rather than similar or duplicative applications, which are only provided to a subset of the ministry.	Duplicative capability is expensive in terms of both CAPEX and OPEX and proliferates conflicting data. 	1) Departments in ministry, which depend on the application(s), which does not serve the entire ministry, must change over to ministry-wide application(s).2) ministry departments should not be allowed to develop an application for their own use that is similar or duplicative of ministry-wide application.									1900-01-01	1900-01-01			1	admin	2022-05-24	23:14:21	 	 	 	Create	1	\N	2022-05-24 23:14:22
11	Technology Neutral		MIMEAPRINCIPLE011	Application	High	Applications are independent of specific vendor and technology choices and therefore can operate on a variety of vendor and technology.	The choice for different technologies will provide the application’s ability to run on multiple hardware and platforms.Independence of applications from the underlying technology allows applications to be developed, upgraded, and operated in the most cost-effective and timely way.Realizing that every decision made with respect to IT creates a dependency on the underlying technology, the intent of this principle is to ensure that business application software is not dependent on specific hardware and operating system.	1) This principle will require standards that support portability. 2) Subsystem interfaces will need to be developed to enable legacy applications to interoperate with applications and operating environments developed under the enterprise architecture.3) Middleware should be used to decouple applications from specific hardware and operating systems.									1900-01-01	1900-01-01			1	admin	2022-05-24	23:14:21	 	 	 	Create	1	\N	2022-05-24 23:14:22
12	Ease of Use		MIMEAPRINCIPLE012	Application	High	Applications are easy to use so that users can concentrate on their tasks without boggling about the underlying technology and implementation.	An intuitive, consistent and easy to use interface enhances user experience and improves stickiness.The more a user has to understand the underlying technology, the less productive that user is. Ease-of-use encourages users to work within the integrated information environment instead of developing isolated systems to accomplish the task outside of the ministry's integrated information environment. Most of the knowledge required to operate one system will be similar to others. Training is kept to a minimum, and the risk of using a system improperly is low.	1) Applications are required to have a common "look-and-feel" and support ergonomic requirements. Hence, the common look-and-feel standard must be designed and usability test criteria must be developed. 2) Guidelines for user interfaces should not be constrained by narrow assumptions about user location, language, systems training, or physical capability. Factors such as linguistics, customer physical infirmities (visual acuity, ability to use keyboard/mouse), and proficiency in the use of technology have broad ramifications in determining the ease-of-use of an application.3) Applications should have both Arabic and English easily switchable interfaces, wherever applicable.									1900-01-01	1900-01-01			1	admin	2022-05-24	23:14:21	 	 	 	Create	1	\N	2022-05-24 23:14:22
13	Cloud First		MIMEAPRINCIPLE013	Technology	High	Think cloud first approach. This could be a private cloud (hosted cloud using commercial stacks or open stack) or a public cloud (STC, AWS or Azure etc.) or a combination.	Digital systems are expected to be ubiquitous systems across geographies and locations. Digital systems are also expected to be agile and flexible. Cloud-based services and deployments enable flexibility, agility, scalability and performance to deliver services.	1) Not every IT service will be appropriate for delivery via the cloud.2) Evaluation criteria need to be created to provide the basis for an assessment model that can be used to justify cloud decisions.3) ministry must adopt the ITSM best practices.4) Cloud services must not be procured directly by business teams. This can unintentionally introduce unnecessary OPEX costs and inhibit reuse.									1900-01-01	1900-01-01			1	admin	2022-05-24	23:14:21	 	 	 	Create	1	\N	2022-05-24 23:14:22
14	Technology Standardization		MIMEAPRINCIPLE014	Technology	High	Software and hardware should conform to defined standards that promote interoperability for business processes, data, applications, and technology.	Standards help ensure consistency, thus improving the ability to manage systems and improve user satisfaction, and protect existing IT investments, thus maximizing return on investment and reducing costs. Standards for interoperability additionally help ensure support from multiple vendors for their products and facilitate supply chain integration.	1) Ministry is encouraged to adopt and comply with EA standards.2) Ministry must follow standards unless there is a compelling business reason to implement a non-standard solution. 3) A process for setting standards, reviewing and revising them periodically, and granting exceptions must be established. 4) The existing IT solutions must be identified, documented and rationalized to improve technology standardization.									1900-01-01	1900-01-01			1	admin	2022-05-24	23:14:21	 	 	 	Create	1	\N	2022-05-24 23:14:22
15	Reuse before Buy		MIMEAPRINCIPLE015	Technology	High	Instead of starting from scratch, it is beneficial to adapt and enhance existing technology products, resources and approaches.	Reuse provides value for money by standardizing and simplifying the IT landscape, reducing data and technology duplication and adopting common business processes while bringing in global best practices.	1) Ministry needs to reduce the emphasis on program-centric silo funding and to leverage the use of ministry-level initiatives, capabilities and resources wherever practical.2) Sharing and reusing IT and information assets and services to support service delivery takes precedence over standalone and isolated systems3) Reuse of assets is preferred for purchasing new systems. Systems should be acquired with the future need of sharing and reuse in mind. Systems that enable sharing and reuse should, therefore, be preferred over systems for which reuse or sharing will be difficult.4) Buying new systems, or implementing non-standard solutions, is only undertaken as a last resort when there are clear and demonstrable business benefits.5) Ministry should enhance its ability to integrate applications and to provide common functions that could be leveraged by new applications.  Integration complexity should be reduced.6) Ministry needs to consider modifying its business processes (in conjunction with the use of unmodified COTS, for example) before implementing and modifying a new solution.									1900-01-01	1900-01-01			1	admin	2022-05-24	23:14:21	 	 	 	Create	1	\N	2022-05-24 23:14:22
16	Business to Drive Technology Architecture		MIMEAPRINCIPLE016	Technology	High	The changes to technology architecture shall be me made in response to business needs and not the other way round.	This principle will foster an atmosphere where the IT changes in response to the needs of the business, rather than having the business change in response to IT changes. Therefore, involuntary effects on businesses resulting from IT changes are mitigated.However, technology changes can generate opportunities to improve and improvise the business process.	1) Changes in implementation should follow a full examination of the proposed changes using enterprise architecture.2) System development or technical improvement should not be implemented unless there is a documented business need.3) The business need must be given preference; however, it must also be aligned with other enterprise architecture principles. There must be a balance between business needs and IT operations.									1900-01-01	1900-01-01			1	admin	2022-05-24	23:14:21	 	 	 	Create	1	\N	2022-05-24 23:14:22
17	Prefer Open Source Technology		MIMEAPRINCIPLE017	Technology	High	An open source approach to application and technology development can help to increase interoperability and collaboration in the digital development community and avoid duplicating work that has already been done by other organization.	Rationale Closed proprietary standards and software restrict reuse, reduce interoperability and can create vendor lock-in that leads to unforeseen financial costs.	1) Exit, rebid and rebuild costs must be taken into consideration during procurement decisions for the best value for money comparisons, between open source and proprietary solutions.2) Ministry should consider open-source software alongside commercial software equivalents from a total cost of ownership perspective.3) Ministry must ensure the availability of continuous support and maintenance for intended open source solutions.4) Ministry must evaluate open-source technology from the security perspective and must apply appropriate security controls to improve the security of the adopted open source technology.5) Open standards must be used in all solution designs to enable interoperability.									1900-01-01	1900-01-01			1	admin	2022-05-24	23:14:21	 	 	 	Create	1	\N	2022-05-24 23:14:22
18	Scalability and Modularity		MIMEAPRINCIPLE018	Technology	High	Ministry technology (both hardware and software) architectures should be scalable, flexible and modular to meet ongoing and dynamic business growth.	Modular components have well-defined inputs and outputs.Loosely coupled components interoperate well but are not dependent on each other’s implementation specifics. Loose coupling is critical to achieving the graceful evolution of system function over time.	1) Standard scalability design patterns for each architectural domain should be published and periodically updated.2) A repository should be created to store modular components3) Component relationships need to be carefully designed early in the design cycle to ensure integration objectives are met while preserving loose coupling.4) Modular design is also a primary attribute leading to scalability. As demand varies, individual components can be added or removed to alter supply as needed. Furthermore, if there is a demand variance between different services, modular components can be shifted between services making the most of every resource. This is especially advantageous when using virtualization technology.									1900-01-01	1900-01-01			1	admin	2022-05-24	23:14:21	 	 	 	Create	1	\N	2022-05-24 23:14:22
19	Interoperability		MIMEAPRINCIPLE019	Technology	High	Software, hardware, and management and development processes should conform to defined standards that promote interoperability for data, applications, and technology.	Interoperability enables flexibility, reusability and adaptability in sharing information, systems, and processes within the ministry and across government.Interoperability ensures support from multiple vendors for their products and facilitates flexible application integration.	1) Interoperability and industry standards must be followed unless there is a mandatory business reason to implement a non-standard solution.20 A process to establish standards, periodic revision, and exceptions must be established.3) Current IT platforms must be identified and documented.									1900-01-01	1900-01-01			1	admin	2022-05-24	23:14:22	 	 	 	Create	1	\N	2022-05-24 23:14:22
20	Security by Design		MIMEAPRINCIPLE020	Information Security	High	Security is embedded into business, application, data and technology architecture.	The principle will ensure that security is realized at the enterprise level not just an IT issue.It will ensure the security risks are mitigated across all the landscapes business as well as IT and will ensure security is driven by the business and organizational priorities and issues.	1) Comprehensive security operating model is required to be developed across people process and technology.2) Additional processes will be required to design and develop for managing various aspects of security from Application, Data, Infrastructure, and business3) Clear principles for the security of Application, Infrastructure, Data and Business will be required during the solution design phase4) Additional governance will be required to set up to ensure security is embedded and practiced across the ministry.5) Tools procurement will be required to set up security practice across the whole landscape									1900-01-01	1900-01-01			1	admin	2022-05-24	23:14:22	 	 	 	Create	1	\N	2022-05-24 23:14:22
21	Information is Secured		MIMEAPRINCIPLE021	Information Security	High	Information is protected based on the principle of availability, confidentiality, integrity and authenticity. Security adherence for data sharing will ensure applying the required criteria using the auditing system and monitoring tools.	While access to information is allowed for business reasons, sensitivities and propriety control is important to be safeguarded.Any unrestricted and free access raises the security risk for data and information to be misused and can jeopardize the business interest and integrity of the whole ministry.	1) Classification of data into confidential and non-confidential categories will be key process.2) The level of confidentiality can be reviewed and defined by data proprietors and functional teams.3) Data security should be an integral part of overall security governance.4) Security for data elements to be part of the design from the initial phase.5) Specific tools procurement will be required to set up security practice across the whole landscape.									1900-01-01	1900-01-01			1	admin	2022-05-24	23:14:22	 	 	 	Create	1	\N	2022-05-24 23:14:22
22	Information is Classified		MIMEAPRINCIPLE022	Information Security	High	An information asset’s classification is determined by its value and risk.	A fundamental understanding of the value of an information asset to the business and the business risk if it is exposed, corrupted, or lost is essential to determining the appropriate strategies and investments to make for protecting and managing it.This also optimizes the security expenditure, provides justification of information security spending and mitigation of possible overspending.	1) Ministry’s information/data standards should be identified.2) Ministry must approve and enforce information and assets classification policy.3) Ministry must classify all valuable information and assets based on the adopted classification scheme.4) Information/data should be maintained in a separate data layer decoupled from applications.5) Ministry shall deploy appropriate security controls commensurate with information and assets classification.									1900-01-01	1900-01-01			1	admin	2022-05-24	23:14:22	 	 	 	Create	1	\N	2022-05-24 23:14:22
